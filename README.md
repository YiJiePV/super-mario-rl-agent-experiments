# super-mario-rl-agent-experiments
Testing RL agents on the Super Mario classic game.

Using the [gym-super-mario-bros](https://github.com/Kautenja/gym-super-mario-bros/tree/master) [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment, which contains Super Mario Bros. & Super Mario Bros. 2 (Lost Levels), played using this [Python-based NES emulator](https://github.com/Kautenja/nes-py).

I love studying learning machines, and I'd love to find ways to test ways to make them reinforcement learn better and faster with this environment. Might write some research papers on it, someday, maybe.
